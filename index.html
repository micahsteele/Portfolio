            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Micah Steele. I previously worked in finance for a couple years. I was an Investment Executive
                at Raymond James. I worked with over 400 clients. I delivered diversified retirement, investment, and 
                insurance advice-based solutions to meet the individualized needs of current clients and prospects. 
            </p>
            <p>My spouse and I decided to move to Australia. During that change I decided I wanted to pursue a career change.
                I began studying and working on website development. I am currently taking a codeAcademy course to become a Full-Stack
                Engineer. I am enjoying the learning and discovery process.
            </p>
            <p>I am a proactive and adaptable professional who excels in problem-solving and delivering high-quality results. 
                I am passionate about my journey as a Full-Stack Engineer, and I am excited about the possibility of joining 
                your organization to further grow my skills and contribute to its continued success.
                I am confident that my strong work ethic and commitment to excellence will be an asset to your team.
